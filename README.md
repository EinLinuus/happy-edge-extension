Theoretically, this should be a nice little extension that adds to CTRL+TAB experience from Arc browser to Microsoft Edge.

However, since I have no idea how to build this "switcher ui" that pops up when you press CTRL+TAB, only the "switcher" part is implemented. This means that you can switch between tabs using CTRL+TAB, but you won't see any UI.

:/
